# Seasonal Timeline ðŸŒ±

**Seasonal timeline** is a web application designed to inform the users about the fruits and vegetables they eat and help promote sustainable, healthy habits; as well as connecting local producers to potential customers.

<br>

## Goals

The goal of this project was to experience developing a full-stack app â€” from conception and planning to deployment â€” while practicing all I learned at Codaisseur's Full Stack JavaScript Academy and also discovering new tools and technologies.

<br>

## Technologies used

### Frontend:

- React
- Redux
- Axios
- SVG

### Backend

- Express
- Sequelize
- Postgres

<br>

<!-- ## Usability

## User Stories

### As a regular user, I want to:

- be able to see what fruits and vegetables are in season in my region or other places.

- be able to have an overview of which produces are in season around the year.

- be able to see more information about each produce and find local producers.

### As a producer, I want to:

- be able to login and set up my business page so I can reach potential customers.
- be able to update my page and change the fruits and vegetables I offer.

  <br>

## Next Features

- Set up a map so the user can see where the local producers are located.
- List recipes in the details page of each fruits and vegetables.
- Create login option for consumers, so they can set up their likes and dislikes and favorite recipes.
